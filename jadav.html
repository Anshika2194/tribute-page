  <h2>Reforestation Hero: Jadav Payeng</h2>
  <h2>“I’ll plant till my last breath.” - Padma Shri Jadav "Molai" Payeng</h2>
  <p><b>Ordained the “Forest Man of India” by the former president of India, Jadav Payeng planted a tree a day and created a man-made forest bigger than NYC Central Park.The forest,
    called Molai forest after Jadav Molai Payeng, is located near Kokilamukh of Jorhat in Assam. It
    encompasses an area of about 1,360 acres per 550 hectares.</b></p>

      <h1>About The Legend</h1>
      <p>At 16, environmental activist Jadav “Molai” Payeng saw hundreds of dead snakes, the victims of a major drought occurring on Majuli Reserve—the world’s largest river island located in the Brahmaputra river in India. Even at such a young age, he knew that someone had to do something, so in 1979, at 16-years old he started planting a tree sapling a day in the barren soil. Now over 40 years later, his forest covers 1,390 acres—approximately the size of 15 football stadiums. Jadav left behind his formal education to give all his attention to the forest. The son of a buffalo trader, Jadav grew up a poor farmer from a marginalized tribal community in Assam, India.

        The Mulai Reserve was once a place of wonder with an area of approximately 2,500 acres. But every year during the monsoon season, the river floods everything in sight, destroying homes and farms causing erosion. The land is now under constant threat because of extensive soil erosion on its banks. Every year In the past seventy years the reserve has diminished by more than fifty percent and there are concerns it will be fully submerged within twenty years causing the 150,000 inhabitants to lose their homes and livelihoods.
